                <h2>The old man the boat</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>If you think that <strong>"man"</strong> is a modified noun by the adjective <strong>"old"</strong>, you're wrong. The truth is, it acts as a verb meaning: <em>"operate", "work", or "run" some equipment</em>. So you read the sentence like this: "The old <strong><em>[people]</em></strong> man<strong><em>[operate]</em></strong> the boat</p>

                <h2>Fat people eat accumulates</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>I can assure you that I was as confused as you initially. You see the verb has <strong>"-s"</strong> at the end, indicating it takes a single noun. Push <strong>"people"</strong> out of the subject and group it with <strong>"eat"</strong>, then you have: "Fat, people eat, accumulates" [i.e., "The fat that people eat accumulates in their bodies"]</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>Well, if you pay attention a little better in class, you'd not have revealed the answer so effortlessly. The sentence has already been reduced. Originally, it goes like this: "The man [who whistles] tunes pianos" </p>

                    <p>No, it's not the man who fell. What it's trying to say is: "The man pushed through the door <strong>[and]</strong> it <strong>[the door]</strong> fell" </p>
